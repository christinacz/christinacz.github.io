title: I'm working on it!

I graduated my Master's program with a class of newbie UX designers, data analysts, and librarians. We start our conversations with, "Can I see your portfolio?"

I'm in the first year of my first job as an information and UX professional. This is a placeholder for what will eventually be a record of my design, DevOps, and project management work. Thanks for checking in.
