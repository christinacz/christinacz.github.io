Hi! I'm a recent graduate from the Master's program in Information and Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan. I currently work as a web and informatics project manager. I'm part-teacher, part-designer, part-marketer and learning most things along the way. 

I'm most interested in civic technology and ways to reimagine how we use information and technology to serve communities and social justice.

### More Information

I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I love my cat BB and all foods.
